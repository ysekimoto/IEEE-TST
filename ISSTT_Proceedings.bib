Equat,ion (14) reduces readily to the axial form (limp + 0) given earlier in [l, eq. (25)]. A comparison of the calculated E , using both (14) and the numerical differentiation form of [l, eq.

Equation (14) is found to be much more efficient, its evaluation requiring approximately one-tenth the computer time needed for [l, eq. (12)]. The simpliiication thus achieved for the computation of El is perhaps somexhat fortuitous in t,hat. the same procedure does not reduce the complexity for calculat.ing E,. Thus the numerical differentiation process given in [l] is still needed for the computa tion of E,. However, the simpler form for E, in (14) can certainly be employed to good advantage in a study of ground-plane mounted antennas, part.icularly, in an analysis of arrays of parallel monopoles such as the Yagi-Uda and log-periodic antennas, =-here the only knowledge needed of the excitation from the primary frill drive is the z component of elect.ric field E , on the wire elements.

abstract = {A side-fed crossed Dragone telescope provides a wide field of view. This type of telescope is commonly employed in the measurement of cosmic microwave background polarization, which requires an image-space telecentric telescope with a large focal plane over broadband coverage. We report the design of a wide field-of-view crossed Dragone optical system using anamorphic aspherical surfaces with correction terms up to the 10th order. We achieved a Strehl ratio larger than 0.95 over 32×18 square degrees at 150 GHz. This design is an image-space telecentric and fully diffraction-limited system below 400 GHz. We discuss the optical performance in the uniformity of the axially symmetric point-spread function and telecentricity over the field of view. We also address the analysis to evaluate the polarization properties, including the instrumental polarization, extinction rate, and polarization angle rotation. This work is a part of a program to design a compact multi-color wide-field-of-view telescope for LiteBIRD, which is a next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization satellite.},

abstract = {We have developed a near-field vector beam measurement system covering the range of frequencies from 385 to 500 GHz. The measurement set-up is capable of measurements with dynamic range exceeding 50 dB and amplitude and phase stability respectively of 0.1 dB/h and 1 degree/5 min at room temperature. Beam patterns of the ALMA band 8 corrugated horns and receiver optics block were measured at room temperature and lately compared with physical optics calculations obtained in the far-field. Both co-polar and cross-polar beam patterns of a qualification model of the ALMA band 8 cartridge cooled in a cartridge-test-cryostat have also been measured in the near-field as a detector of a submillimeter vector network analyzer. The measurements presented in this work refer to the lowest, middle and upper frequencies of band 8. The comparisons between software model and experimental measurements at these frequencies show good agreement down to −30 dB for the main polarization component. The cross-polarization level of the beam propagating through the receiver optics block was also characterized. We found that a cross-polarization level better than −28 dB can be achieved at all measured frequencies. The measured beam pattern of this receiver corresponds to efficiency of greater than 92{\%} at the sub reflector (diameter of 750 mm) of the ALMA 12 m optics.},

Because of this gravity wave detection is not limited by cosmic variance as in the case of temperature fluctuations. We present the exact expressions for various polarization power spectra, which are valid on any scale. Numerical evaluation in inflation-based models shows that the expected signal is of the order of 0.5 {\$}\backslashmu K{\$}, which could be directly tested in future CMB experiments.},

abstract="Inflation is the leading theory of the first instant of the universe. Inflation, which postulates that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion an instant after its birth, provides convincing explanation for cosmological observations. Recent advancements in detector technology have opened opportunities to explore primordial gravitational waves generated by the inflation through ``B-mode'' (divergent-free) polarization pattern embedded in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies. If detected, these signals would provide strong evidence for inflation, point to the correct model for inflation, and open a window to physics at ultra-high energies. LiteBIRD is a satellite mission with a goal of detecting degree-and-larger-angular-scale B-mode polarization. LiteBIRD will observe at the second Lagrange point with a 400 mm diameter telescope and 2622 detectors. It will survey the entire sky with 15 frequency bands from 40 to 400 GHz to measure and subtract foregrounds. The US LiteBIRD team is proposing to deliver sub-Kelvin instruments that include detectors and readout electronics. A lenslet-coupled sinuous antenna array will cover low-frequency bands (40--235 GHz) with four frequency arrangements of trichroic pixels. An orthomode-transducer-coupled corrugated horn array will cover high-frequency bands (280--402 GHz) with three types of single frequency detectors. The detectors will be made with transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers cooled to a 100 milli-Kelvin base temperature by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator. The TES bolometers will be read out using digital frequency multiplexing with Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifiers. Up to 78 bolometers will be multiplexed with a single SQUID amplifier. We report on the sub-Kelvin instrument design and ongoing developments for the LiteBIRD mission.",

abstract = {This paper examines the performance of dual-linear sinuous antennas on silicon extended hemispherical silicon dielectric lenses. A theoretical impedance of 106 $\Omega$ is identified based on the analysis of an ideal self-complementary structure, and this result compares well with simulations and measurements. The radiation properties of a linearly polarized sinuous antenna are simulated using Method of Moments software coupled to a GO/PO code, and also agree well with measurements. The results indicate that the sinuous antenna is an excellent wideband planar feed for a silicon lens, with cross-polarization levels below -17 dB, and polarization variations of ±5° over two octaves in frequency. The application areas are millimeter-wave, wideband, dual-polarized radio-astronomy receivers.},
